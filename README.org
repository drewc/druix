#+TITLE: Druix: Drew's (G)uix

Druix is a distribution of GNU/Linux that's focused on usability. It is based
off of a GNU Guix Channel, amoung other things.

GNU Guix is a cross-platform package manager and a tool to instantiate and
manage Unix-like operating systems.

Please do NOT promote this repository on any official Guix communication
channels, such as their mailing lists or IRC channel, even in response to
support requests! This is to show respect for the Guix projectâ€™s strict policy
against recommending nonfree software, and to avoid any unnecessary hostility.

* NonGuix/NonGNU

#+begin_quote
Nonguix is a software repository for the GNU Guix package manager, which
packages some software which cannot be included in the official distribution for
ethical or policy-related reasons.

Most of my PC's are Thinkpads. Most of them use a "non-free" driver for WiFi,
and they are all Intel or AMD, with firmware updates, etc.

Because of that they require a "non-free" linux kernel and some binary blobs
that Guix refuses to include (for good reason!). My priorities and philosophies
somewhat differ and my freedom is my ability to choose "non-free" hardware :).

I want a single channel AKA monorepo even though I am including external repos. That's where a subtree comes into play.

** Clone the upstream repo

#+begin_src shell
cd ~/me/guix/src
git clone git@gitlab.com:nonguix/nonguix.git
#+end_src

** Split the two subtrees

#+begin_src shell
cd nonguix;
git subtree split --prefix=nonguix --branch=nonguix
git subtree split --prefix=nongnu --branch=nongnu
#+end_src

** Also add the README as another branch

Change README.org into nonguix.org and we'll stick it in a doc/ folder.
``
#+begin_src shell
git branch --track README
rm -r .giti* .gu* .d* COPYING news.txt nong*
git mv README.org nonguix.org
git commit -m "Remove all but README->nonguix.org"
#+end_src
