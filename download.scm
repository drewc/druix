  "Return a fixed-output derivation that fetches URL (a string) which is expected
to have HASH of type HASH-ALGO (a symbol).  By default, the file name is the base
name of URL; optionally, NAME can specify a different file name.

This is a simpler version of url-fetch from Guix, that doesn't support mirror://
or file:// uris.  It is specifically designed to prevent substitution of the
source, for the purpose of downloading copyrighted content you have access to,
but you don't have the right to redistribute.  By marking the derivation as non
substitutable, this fetch prevents you from giving others access to the source
if you run a substitute server on your machine."
